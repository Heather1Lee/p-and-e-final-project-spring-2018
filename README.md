# Journey of Finding Spam

<p>Project Journey of Finding Spam is a room escape style of interactive game.</p>

## Summary

<p> 
For input, I used a color sensor TCS230 and a solenoid for output. To connect them together, I used Arduino Uno from Sparkfun. As it is shown on the picture, There are total 3 main boxes made out of foamcore. Each box needs each proper key or method to unlock the doors. By unlocking the first and second boxes, you can collect total 3 mini cubes which the inside of them is filled with 3 different color papers - red, green and blue. If you put the mini cubes on the color sensor in a right sequence, the solenoid will be unlocked and the door will be opened too. Eventually, you'll be able to get the real spam.

<p> 
The 24v solenoid was the only solenoid in the Hybrid Lab. I couldn't find another solenoid that requires lower power. In other words, it was challenging to me to give proper amount of power to the solenoid. I couldn't figure out how to connect the solenoid with the color sensor.

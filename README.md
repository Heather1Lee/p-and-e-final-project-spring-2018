# Journey of Finding Spam

<p>Project Journey of Finding Spam is a room escape style of interactive game.</p>

## Summary

<p> 
For input, I used a color sensor TCS230 and a solenoid for output. To connect them together, I used Arduino Uno from Sparkfun. As it is shown on the picture, There are total 3 main boxes made out of foamcore. Each box needs each proper key or method to unlock the doors. By unlocking the first and second boxes, you can collect total 3 mini cubes which the inside of them is filled with 3 different color papers - red, green and blue. If you put the mini cubes on the color sensor in a right sequence, the solenoid will be unlocked and the door will be opened too. Eventually, you'll be able to get the real spam.

The 24v solenoid was the only solenoid in the Hybrid Lab. I couldn't find another solenoid that requires lower power. In other words, it was challenging to me to give proper amount of power to the solenoid. I couldn't figure out how to connect the solenoid with the color sensor.

## Component Parts

From what pieces did you build your project?

Include what types of inputs/outputs/data it will use, and a block diagram showing how all those pieces are connected.

## Challenges

A brief discussion of what was hard, challenging, or unexpected about your project.

## Timeline

What did you do in each of the past five weeks

<p>- Week 1: Thought about final project.</p>
<p>- Week 2: Finished final project proposal and ordered electronic parts which are Adafruit color sensor and magnetic doorlock. </p>
<p>- Week 3: Electronic parts delivery delayed, and started making a diagram. </p>
<p>- Week 4: Changed the plan to use TCS230 color sensor and 24v solenoid and ordered the sensor again. </p>
<p>- Week 5: Presented!</p>
